# TouchExt
Short class for Unity to manage simple (one click) user input on desktop and mobile devices.

## Version of Unity used
* Unity 5.4+
* Should work on 4.7.x (I guess you will have to replace UNITY_IOS by UNITY_IPHONE in the script preprocessor part)

## To do
* Keyboard management
* Perform a code cleanup: it looks like instance variable is not needed as this class works statically.
